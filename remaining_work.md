- First have to add the home screen just to make it have the core functionality of chat module.
- After that Have to add the login and sign up module same as the jewelify and integrate it into the English companion.
- Have to add loading screen which shows that how to use the core modules of the app like noraml chat module, voice module etc. But this is going to be useful when i add the formal, informal caht and voice module also. I think this will might be needed or not also as this app is going to be neat and clean and also the user friendly also.
